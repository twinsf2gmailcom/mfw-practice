        <h1>Stephanie Flora</h1>
        <p>I grew up in the Modesto area.  When to school at MJC and the CSU Stanislaus. After getting my BS I moved to the 
          Monterey Bay area to get a Masters Degree in Marine Science at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML).  I finished my 
          degree in May 2001.  I got a job at MLML working on the Marine Optical BouY (MOBY) project as the data processor and 
          programmer.  I have been writing programs mainly in Matlab for 25 years.  I have started learning python as well.
          When I started at MLML in the mid 1990's the web and internet was just starting.  I got tasked with writing our labs 
          webpages.  So I have been writing html for a long time.  But my pages still look like they are from the 1990's.  So 
          when I moved from the Monterey Bay area last year and found out about these classes they where exactly what I needed to
          update my webpage skills.  The wordpress (pretty) version of our page <a href="https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/moby/">https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/moby/</a> and my data pages which
          I am hoping to update <a href="http://data.moby.mlml.calstate.edu/">http://data.moby.mlml.calstate.edu/</a>.  The new page
          I created in the websites for beginners class <a href="http://data.moby.mlml.calstate.edu/status2/status.html">MOBY Status page</a>
